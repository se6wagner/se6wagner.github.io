                    <h1>CTA Coaching</h1>
                    <p>
                    The last step of the Salesforce Certified Technical Architect examination process - the board review - not only represents a big challenge even for the most experienced architects, it also has a <u>very low pass rate amongst Salesforce partners (25%</u> - as provided by SFDC during 'Seed-The partner workshop' in April 2013). Even though Salesforce provides a large set of reference material and a small set hypothetical case studies for practice, they do not provide much support beyond that.
                    This coaching program has been tail-ordered to bridge this gap and to prepare candidates in the best possible way based on the following elements:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Candidate assessment</li>
                        <li>Knowledge transfer through demos and presentations</li>
                        <li>Theoretical exercises on board relevant topics</li>
                        <li>Practical exercises in form of hypothetical case studies</li>
                        <li>CTA clinic</li>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    It is especially valuable for independent contractors and freelancers or architects working for customers who don't have access to other Salesforce resources or fellow CTAs.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Format</h3>
                    <p>The program is structured as a series of remote sessions (up to 1.5 hrs) that are held over the course of multiple weeks. In general the sessions are on a 1-to-1 basis.</p>
                    <h3>Fees</h3>
                    <p>
                    For details about fees please get in touch
                    <SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript">

                    document.write('<A href="mailto:' + emailE + '">'+ emailE + '</a>')
                    </SCRIPT>
                    <br/>
                    Fees can be partially refunded, if the candidate decides to quit the program based on the assessment result.

                        <span>
                        <b>Assessment (1-to-1)</b><br/>
                        <p>
                        <i>Introduction to the program and student assessment through a hypothetical case study.</i><br/>
                        Involves a review of your technical skills and experience with regards to what is expected for the student.
                        </p>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                        <b>Board Strategies & Best Practices</b><br/>
                        <p>
                        <i>Provide a detailed insight of the board and strategies.</i><br/>
                        Students will learn what 'thinking on your feet' and other challenges mean and how they can address them effectively. Furthermore topics such as 'How to choose the right case study?' or 'How to respond to questions?' will be covered by this module. And we'll share best practices on preparation and presentation case studies incl. a 'solution design story template'
                        </p>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                        <b>Architecture Exercises</b><br/>
                        <p>
                        <i>Theoretical exercises to gain and harden in-depth technical knowledge.</i><br/>
                        The student will receive assignments for which he will have to prepare material on questions and issues related to the following topics: Platform Architecture, Security, Integration, Governance and Testing.
                        </p>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                        <b>Hypothetical case studies 101</b><br/>
                        <p>
                        <i>Practical exercises for preparation, presentation and justification of solution design based hypothetical case studies.</i><br/>
                        Simulations of the board review, in which students have 60min to prepare a solution design, followed by 25 min presentation and 25 min QA. Through the iterative approach of multiple exercises with practice and feedback, students will improve their skills and lay the foundation for the module's 201 and ultimately the board review.
                        </p>
                        </span>
                        <span>
                        <b>Hypothetical case studies 201</b><br/>
                        <p>
                        <i>Similar to 101, but case studies' complexity and length match the ones of the boardâ€˜s.</i><br/>
                        As close as it gets to the hypothetical case study of the board. The student will have 75 min (native english speakers) or 105 min to prepare based on a large case study, followed by 30min presentation and 30min QA.
